# Healthlocker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/healthlocker/healthlocker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/healthlocker/healthlocker) [![Deps Status](https://beta.hexfaktor.org/badge/all/github/healthlocker/healthlocker.svg)](https://beta.hexfaktor.org/github/healthlocker/healthlocker)

Healthlocker is a secure platform powered by the South London and Maudsley NHS
Foundation Trust (the trust) that promotes supported self-management and
opportunities to improve communication between service users, carers and
clinicians. A full list of features can be found
[here](https://github.com/healthlocker/healthlocker#current-features).

## Getting started (Using Vagrant)

* Clone the repo
* `cd` in the repo
* Update the line in the Vagrantfile that says "Your path to Healthlocker here"
with the path to where you cloned the repo
* Run the command `vagrant up` in the terminal

This will take a few minutes to set up but once it is complete you will be able to
visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser
and checkout the [styleguide](http://localhost:4000/components).

You will not be able to access any data from the ePJS database

More instructions on how to use vagrant can be found [here](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-vagrant)

Ready to run in production? Please [check the deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).

### Testing

We use [`ExUnit`](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/ex_unit/) and
[`wallaby`](https://github.com/keathley/wallaby) for testing. Wallaby has a
dependency on phantomjs. You can follow their
[instructions](https://github.com/keathley/wallaby#phantomjs) to install it.

After that you should be able to run `mix test` and see lots of green!

### Routes

You can view all of the routes by running `mix phoenix.routes` in your terminal.

### Updating select input options

The dropdown options for security questions, hours slept and wake count from
the sleep tracker, and symptom scale from the symptom tracker can be updated
by following the instructions in [this document](editing-select-options.md).

### Writing tips & stories

The stories and tips can be written using markdown. This will allow you to
style the text as you write it.

You can find a
[guide to common things you may want to do with markdown](markdown-syntax.md)
in this repository.

In addition to formatting the text with markdown, be sure to include `#story`
or `#tip` (with an additional *category* tag) so the story or tip displays on
the correct page.

### Application Architecture

The Healthlocker App is deployed to "Production" in the following configuration:

The cluster of Web Servers is two or more Linux VMs behind a load balancer.

### Infrastructure Overview

There are 4 pieces to the puzzle:

+ Azure **Load Balancer**:
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/load-balancer -
All web traffic is handled through the load balancer which performs
_continous_ health checks on the application server(s) and routes
requests in a "round-robin" to balance load.
  + There is no "_specification_" for Load Balancers on Azure and pricing is FREE!

+ **Linux Virtual Machines** (VMs):
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/virtual-machines - these run our
Phoenix Web Application. The Application is _compiled_ as an _executable_
which runs on "BEAM" (_the Erlang Virtual Machine_).
The VMs are _actively_ monitored and can be scaled up dynamically
dependent on request volume.
  + Production Application Servers:
  ![Linux VM Cost](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/26114633/b3b2dfe6-3a55-11e7-9bb2-795b8a0b94c2.png)
  + Staging Application Server:
  ![staging-vm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/26115765/e6fc29b8-3a58-11e7-8670-0d0dad85352e.png)


+ Azure **PostgreSQL Database-as-a-Service**:
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql - all application data
is stored in an Azure Database instance which is encrypted at rest,
scales dynamically/transparently ("_built-in high availability_")
and backed up transparently. Data is _Only_ accessible from the Production VMs
  + Production Database:
  ![PostgreSQL Pricing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/26114788/2b5afd26-3a56-11e7-8890-0933ab79f10c.png)
  + Staging (Test) Database:
  ![staging-database-price](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/26115192/33959a68-3a57-11e7-89e7-b5c83b1bea22.png)

+ Azure **SQL Server** (_Database-as-a-Service_):
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/sql-database - Stores a _read-only_
_snapshot_ of the "Care Notes" (ePJS) Database. This contains the patients
personal health information and is controlled by the "SLaM" IT team.
Access is restricted to the Production Healthlocker VMs and patient (_personal_)
data is only viewable by the patient and authorized healthcare professionals.
+ Specification for ePJS SQL Server:
![epjs-database](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/26115612/667eb1f2-3a58-11e7-9888-a4753f9ca7ae.png)

* Logged in users can track their sleep over time using the sleep tracker in toolkit
* Users who have tracked sleep can view:
  * hours slept each night over the past week
  * average number of hours slept over the past week
  * times they woke up each night for the past week
  * notes they made about their sleep from the past week
* Users can view the previous 7 days sleep data, or go forward once they've gone back.

### Continuous Integration/Testing and Deployment Pipeline

We use Travis-CI for our continuous integration.
see: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-travis

Release build command:
```
mix edeliver upgrade production --verbose --auto-version=revision
```


### Deployment Guide

In the interest of _reproducibility_ we have produced a
***step-by-step guide*** to deploying a Phoenix Web Application to
Microsoft Azure: <br />
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-microsoft-azure

### Capacity Building Through Documentation & Learning Resources

Unlike _most_ application development Agencies, that attempt to "Lock-in"
clients, the team building Healthlocker are _focussed_ on
building capacity within the NHS to support and _extend_ Healthlocker.

The following learning resources are community-maintained and 100% free/open:

+ Continuous Integration / Deployment: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-travis
+ Elixir Programming Language: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir
+ Phoenix Web Applciation Framework: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework
+ Mobile-first User Interface Library: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tachyons
